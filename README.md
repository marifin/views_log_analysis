# About
This is a reporting tool that analyzes visitor activity on a news website. It queries a PostgreSQL database of over one million records and returns the results in plain text. The tool uses python code to connect to the database to answer these questions:
1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
